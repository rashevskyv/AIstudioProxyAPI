## Configuration Management ‚≠ê

**New Feature**: The project now supports configuration management through `.env` files, avoiding hardcoded parameters!

### Quick Configuration

```bash
# 1. Copy configuration template
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit configuration file
nano .env  # Or use other editor

# 3. Start service (automatically reads configuration)
python gui_launcher.py
# Or direct CLI launch
python launch_camoufox.py --headless
```

### Main Advantages

- ‚úÖ **Worry-free Version Updates**: Complete updates with just a `git pull`, no reconfiguration needed
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Configuration**: All configuration items unified in `.env` file
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Launch Commands**: No complex command-line parameters, one-click startup
- ‚úÖ **Security**: `.env` file is ignored by `.gitignore`, won't leak configuration
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Supports configuration management for different environments
- ‚úÖ **Docker Compatible**: Docker and local environments use the same configuration method

For detailed configuration instructions, see [Environment Variable Configuration Guide](docs/environment-configuration.md).

## Usage Tutorial

Recommended to use [`gui_launcher.py`](gui_launcher.py) (GUI) or directly use [`launch_camoufox.py`](launch_camoufox.py) (CLI) for daily operations. Only use debug mode for initial setup or when authentication expires.

### Quick Start

## External Control Endpoints (New chat / Click Run / Click Stop / Scroll)

These auxiliary endpoints allow triggering UI operations on the AI Studio page from external sources (create new session, click Run, click Stop). Only available when the browser and page have been successfully initialized.

- Authentication: API Key middleware only protects endpoints starting with `/v1/`. The `/api/*` endpoints in this document do not require authentication by default. If protection is needed, add authentication in reverse proxy or custom middleware.
- Prerequisites: Service is started, `Playwright` successfully connects to browser, page is not closed; generally need to configure `CAMOUFOX_WS_ENDPOINT` (unless using `direct_debug_no_browser` mode).

### 1) Create New Session (New chat)

- Method: POST
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/new-chat`
- Request body: None
- Success return:

```json
{"success": true, "message": "New chat created successfully."}
```

- Possible errors:
  - `503 Browser page is not available`: Browser page unavailable/not connected
  - `500 Failed to create a new chat`: Click or confirmation process failed

- Example:

PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/new-chat"
```

curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/new-chat
```

### 2) Trigger Run Button (Click Run)

- Method: POST
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-run`
- Request body (optional):

```json
{"delay_ms": 0}
```

- Description: `delay_ms` is the delay before clicking (milliseconds). If a confirmation overlay exists on the page, it will automatically click confirmation first then try to click Run; if the button is not ready/disabled, it will not click this time.
- Success return:

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Run clicked.", "delay_ms": 0}
```

- Possible errors:
  - `503 Browser page is not available`: Browser page unavailable/not connected
  - `500 Failed to click Run`: Button not visible/not enabled or click failed

- Example:

PowerShell (500ms delay)

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-run" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"delay_ms":500}'
```

curl (500ms delay)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delay_ms":500}'
```

- Usage suggestion: If you want to "resend/re-execute" after page generation ends, set `delay_ms` to 300‚Äì1000ms to avoid instantaneous not-ready states.

### 3) Trigger Stop Button (Click Stop)

- Method: POST
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-stop`
- Request body (optional):

```json
{"delay_ms": 0}
```

- Description: Stop and Run use the same toggle button. When called, it will try to wait for a brief loading indicator (spinner) to appear to ensure it's in a stoppable state; if a confirmation overlay exists, it will auto-confirm first; if the button is not ready/disabled, it will not click this time.
- Success return:

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Stop clicked.", "delay_ms": 0}
```

- Possible errors:
  - `503 Browser page is not available`: Browser page unavailable/not connected
  - `500 Failed to click Stop`: Button not visible/not enabled or click failed

- Example:

PowerShell (500ms delay)

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-stop" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"delay_ms":500}'
```

curl (500ms delay)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/click-stop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delay_ms":500}'
```

- Usage suggestion: If you need to quickly abort generation when client disconnects or quota is reached, set `delay_ms` to 100‚Äì500ms to improve hit probability when in a stoppable state.

### 4) Scroll to Top of Page

- Method: POST
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-top`
- Request body: None
- Success return:

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Scrolled to top of page."}
```

- Possible errors:
  - `503 Browser page is not available`: Browser page unavailable/not connected
  - `500 Failed to scroll to top`: Scroll operation failed

- Example:

PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-top" -ContentType "application/json"
```

curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-top \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 5) Scroll to Bottom of Page

- Method: POST
- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-bottom`
- Request body: None
- Success return:

```json
{"success": true, "message": "Scrolled to bottom of page."}
```

- Possible errors:
  - `503 Browser page is not available`: Browser page unavailable/not connected
  - `500 Failed to scroll to bottom`: Scroll operation failed

- Example:

PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-bottom" -ContentType "application/json"
```

curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:2048/api/scroll-to-bottom \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## About Camoufox

This project uses [Camoufox](https://camoufox.com/) to provide browser instances with enhanced anti-fingerprinting capabilities.

- **Core Goal**: Simulate real user traffic, avoid being identified as automation scripts or robots by websites
- **Implementation**: Camoufox is based on Firefox, disguises device fingerprints (such as screen, operating system, WebGL, fonts, etc.) by modifying browser's underlying C++ implementation, rather than through easily detectable JavaScript injection
- **Playwright Compatible**: Camoufox provides an interface compatible with Playwright
- **Python Interface**: Camoufox provides a Python package that can start its service through `camoufox.server.launch_server()` and control it through WebSocket connections

The main purpose of using Camoufox is to improve stealth when interacting with AI Studio web pages, reducing the possibility of being detected or restricted. But please note that no anti-fingerprinting technology is absolutely perfect.

## Important Notes

### Three-Tier Response Acquisition Mechanism and Parameter Control

- **Response Acquisition Priority**: The project adopts a three-tier response acquisition mechanism to ensure high availability:

  1. **Integrated Streaming Proxy Service**: Enabled by default, port 3120, provides best performance and stability
  2. **External Helper Service**: Optional configuration, requires valid authentication file, as backup
  3. **Playwright Page Interaction**: Final fallback, obtains responses through browser automation

- **Parameter Control Mechanism**:

  - **Streaming Proxy Mode**: Supports basic parameter passing, optimal performance
  - **Helper Service Mode**: Parameter support depends on external service implementation
  - **Playwright Mode**: Full support for all parameters (`temperature`, `max_output_tokens`, `top_p`, `stop`, `reasoning_effort`, etc.)

- **Script Injection Enhancement**: v3.0 version uses Playwright native network interception, ensuring injected models are 100% consistent with native models

### Client History Management

**Client manages history, proxy doesn't support UI editing**: The client is responsible for maintaining complete chat history and sending it to the proxy. The proxy server itself does not support editing or forking historical messages in the AI Studio interface.

## Future Plans

Here are some planned improvement directions:

- **Cloud Server Deployment Guide**: Provide more detailed guides for deploying and managing services on mainstream cloud platforms
- **Authentication Update Process Optimization**: Explore more convenient authentication file update mechanisms, reduce manual operations
- **Process Robustness Optimization**: Reduce error rates and approach native experience
